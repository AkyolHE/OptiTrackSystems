OptiTrack Systems
OptiTrack Systems is an Automotive system where the desired Lap, potential G-forces (accellerations) are be tracked. All of the data is logged and transmitted through the MATLAB drive cloud. The system consist of two parts, Transmitter and Receiver (control centre). In this case, the mobile phone (Transmitter) will be attached to the desired object which would be tracked (i.e. a vehicle). 

Matlab Mobile is mandatory for this System. On the other hand. A live script would be preferred over a normal script. Thus editing and live data exchange would be possible. On the other hand, the live script is stored in the cloud, whereas a normal script would be stored on a drive. 




The system is initialised. The Sensors are active and started logging. The System is ready to use. See OptiTrack Systems.
