% 1. Connect Transmitter to the Internet.

% 2. Connect Receiver to the Internet.

% 3. Open the mlx. file of OptiTrack on the receiver.

% 4. Open MATLAB Mobile on Transmitter.

% 5. Manually go to the sensor setting and select the Stream option,
% instead of logging. 

% 6. On the Receiver, type in the command centre the following code / Or run this code;

m = mobiledev; % Initialising the m device (Transmitter)

m.AccelerationSensorEnabled = 1; % Activating the Acceleration Sensor on the Transmitter.

m.logging = 1; % Enable logging of the Data, it will be logged and streamed to the MATLAB Cloud. 

m.accellog; % Will enable the logging of accellerations (X-Y-Z)

m.PositionSensorEnabled = 1; % This will enable the PositionSensor on the m device.
